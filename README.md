# Predict_delivery_duration

Modelling food delivery duration of a delivery company from the collected data.
Order lateness / underprediction of delivery time is of
particular concern as underestimating delivery time is roughly twice as costly as overestimating it. Orders that are very early / late are also much worse than those that are only slightly early / late. In this exercise, we will explore the dataset and build a model to predict the estimated time taken for a delivery.
This involves exploratory analysis, feature engineering and applying machine learning techniques to best predict the duration between the order creation time and the order delivery time.
